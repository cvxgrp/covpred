# covpred

Covariance prediction via convex optimization (`covpred`) in Python.
This package implements the methods described in the paper [Covariance Prediction via Convex Optimization](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/forecasting_covariances.html).
At a high level, the package creates covariance matrix predictors.
For more details behind the methods, we highly recommend checking out the paper.

## Installation

Run
```
pip install git+https://github.com/cvxgrp/covpred.git
```

## Running the examples

There are two examples, both of which can be found in the `examples` folder. To see how the package is used, we recommend checking out the examples.
